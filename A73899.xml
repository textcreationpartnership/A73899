            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>By this meanes he entred ſo farre and before, in the grace of all the World, that euery one in his thought wiſht he were King: And his Father knowing his right of Succeſſion was to be ſo, and reioycing in his hopes of him, made him to bee Crowned King, and deueſted himſelfe of all Authority, without reſeruing any Power, Right, or Preheminence to himſelfe, onely a Superintendency o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Guard of the King his Sonne, glorying to be Father of ſuch a King: For the admiration he had of his high Vertues, kindled and gaue occaſion betweene them both, of a moſt kind

                  <hi>DEmetrius Phalerius</hi> maſter of the Kings Library, giuing order with the greateſt care hee could, to buy Bookes from all parts of the World: And to that end imploying great numbers of Perſons as Factors ſpread abroad in many places, who had charge to buy and Tranſcript them, they ſo doing, and that dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, the deſigne of the King was accompliſhed and executed, at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the beſt manner for him poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
               <p>For wee being preſent, the King asking him how many thouſand Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes he had gotten together in his Bibliotheicke.

               <p>True it is, that before there had bin ſent with the <hi>Perſians</hi> and other Companies that were ſent againſt the King of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> vnder the Charge of <hi>Pſammiticke:</hi> but all thoſe which were there, were not of ſo great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Therefore his aduice was, that things would not bee well and dnely fabricated, if the Table hee intended to haue made, were more long or high then the other. Therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting all in his Spirits which was

               <p>And truely, how euer, when it is duely conſidered, it appeares a great Miſtery, and may be held for a great Miracle this conformity of ſtile and of Order, to Tranſlate a thing ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But after returning to GOD, and commending himſelfe to his mercy, it was reuealed to him in a Dreame, that his Diſaſter came vpon him for ſo attempting to embelliſh, and (as hee thought) to enrich the Sincerity of the Holy Scriptures with dreſt Words and trim'd Phraſes, and to communicate it ſo to the Pagan, and Infidels.</p>
               <p>It comes alſo into my thought, how <hi>Theodorus</hi> a Tragicke Poet ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly loſt his ſight, for hauing taken one onely paſſage of Holy Writ for argument of his Tragedy: but repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him of the ſame, and doing pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for this forfeit, hee recouered his ſight as before.</p>

               <p>To reconcile theſe ſeuerall Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is to be noted, that of all theſe Fathers ſome onely, as <hi>Iuſtin Martyr, Iraenens, Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> make expreſſe mention of the Cels: the Reſt ſpeake onely of a

               <p>For to come to the Time wherein the Prophet of GOD, MOSES the firſt Writer of Holy Writ, began to Write manifeſtly vnder the Lord of Heauen and Earth; wee may gather, and without preiudice, of all that then could be done: as by a paſſage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many other places wee read of in the 17.

               <p>Therefore if we dilligently ſearch all Antiquities and Writings of men, of all Nations that haue any appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of certayne time, wherein thoſe Writings were made, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conferre thoſe times with the things recited and inregiſtred by the Holy Prophet MOSES, and the time wherein he Writ them: we ſhall ſee manifeſtly the Excellency and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity that he is herein aboue all men: For the Fables and diſguiſments of prophane Poets, <hi>Greekes</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> which all came long time after MO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SES: Amongſt them (I ſay) we ſhal ſee no other but manifeſt Dreames, Lyes; and amongſt other things note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſome corruptions of the Sacred Scriptures long before Written, of
